Analyze your chess games

TODO: 
1. hex architecture for display
2. build set of prompts for analysis per move
3. chat completion API for executing prompts & seeing analysis
    - how can we make this more insightful / understandable?
4. labeling games as nodes that can be connected
    - labels/attributes can include: opponent, opening, date, rating at the time
